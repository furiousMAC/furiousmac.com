The Furious MAC research group at the US Naval Academy was established in 2015 to investigate computer security and privacy topics. The group consists of current and former cyber operations and computer science faculty, as well as undergraduate and recently-graduated student researchers. Furious MAC is especially interested in wireless network identifiers and how they can be leveraged to track users, as well as in evaluating techniques designed to prevent tracking and protect users’ privacy. Furious MAC’s research has been published in numerous highly competitive security and privacy venues.

The group is comprised of researchers from the United States Naval Academy's Departments of Computer Science and Cyber Science, The MITRE Corporation, the United States Navy, Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Measurement and Analysis of Network Data, Carnegie Mellon University, and Northeastern University.
