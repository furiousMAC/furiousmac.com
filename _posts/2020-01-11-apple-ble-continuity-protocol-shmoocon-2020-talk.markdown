Be sure to check out our talk at ShmooCon 2020, 'Reverse Engineering Appleâ€™s BLE Continuity Protocol For Tracking, OS Fingerprinting, and Behavioral Profiling' based on our [research](https://furiousmac.com/files/Handoff_All_Your_Privacy.pdf) from last fall!

Sam Teplov will share the findings that he and the group has been reseaching, including some ongoing updates to our work, and will release a Wireshark dissector during the con! Sam will be presenting at **4 pm** on **Friday** in **One Track Mind**.

We'll post slides and the video from the talk as they become available.
