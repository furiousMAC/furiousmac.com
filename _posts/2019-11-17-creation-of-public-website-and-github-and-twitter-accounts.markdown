Today we are excited to announce the creation of our public website and GitHub & Twitter accounts! These channels will help us more effectively communicate and share our research and hopefully provide additional avenues for collaboration.

Please follow us on Twitter ([@FuriousMAC](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=FuriousMAC)) and be sure to check out our [GitHub page](https://github.com/FuriousMAC)!
